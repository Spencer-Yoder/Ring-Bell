# Ring-Bell

A bell ringing software starts the timer and gets the current time as soon as the program is launched. The schedule.txt file is where the schedule for the bells are set. Each line is the minutes after the starting time of 5 will ring 5 after the starting time and 10 will ring 10 minutes after the starting time. If the file is not found when the program starts it will use the hard-coded time of 10, 15, 55, 60. The Audio can be anything but needs to be saved as bell.wav.
